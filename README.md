<code>//a</code>
with some numbers on their left. change the numbers accordingly to the output of the previous program.

Once compiled, you will have a sethc.exe executable file. replace the one in Windows/system32 with the one you just compiled.
<br/>
<h2>How to run it:</h2>

log out of your account or go to the "switch account" screen, and press 5 times shift.
<br/>
you will be prompted to enter your password, and after that, you'll have system privileges on that shell.
